This is a documentation that describes how to set up a simulation 
scenario with NetKit in order to run our controllers. The NetKit 
includes all required software pieces to carry on such an experiment 
including: OpenvSwitch, Ryu, and Bind. We provide the backbone 
configuration to run our experiments as well as providing a script to 
generate a set of customized end hosts for each customer and a script 
to test our controllers.

=== GETTING STARTED ===

1. Install the experimental version of NetKit.

You can find all documents for installing NetKit in the below link;
